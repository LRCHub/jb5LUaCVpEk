Hey boy Imma getcha

Hey boy once I getcha

Step 1
Do my highlight
Make me shine so bright
in the moonlight
Step 2
Silhouette tight
Baby even my shadow looks

Step 3
When I arrive
Make you look my way
with your heart eyes
Step 4
Get you on the floor
Make ya say more more more
When I say hi

Hi no reason to be
so shy with me

'Til I'm in your head

And you can't forget
You're feeling things now
and you're confused
Watching my body getting loose
You don't know

You're mine
When I say hi
