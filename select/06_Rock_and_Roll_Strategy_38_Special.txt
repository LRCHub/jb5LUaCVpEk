Men like me 'cause I speak my mind
And women like me 'cause I take my time
Try not to make life too serious
I might get burned
If you've got somethin' ta show me
I'm willing ta learn

Got enough trouble just making it day ta day

And when the world starts spinnin' an' I feel like I'm goin' insane

Whoa oh oh oh oh
I got a system that's guaranteed

I got a rock 'n roll strategy

It ain't no science but it works for me
Just a rock 'n roll strategy

Get in my car
Head downtown

Turn up the radio, roll the windows down

It ain't no science but it gets me around
It's just a rock 'n roll strategy
Turn it up!

If you walk down the middle people criticize you for

Sittin' on a fence

And if you walk on the right or you walk on the left
They say you're much too radical to make any sense

Can't win for losin'
Might as well be yourself

And when it gets so confusin' ya feel like checkin' out

Whoa oh oh oh oh
I got a system that's guaranteed

I got a rock 'n roll strategy

It ain't no science but it works for me
It's just a rock 'n roll strategy

Get in my car
Head downtown

Turn up the radio, roll the windows down

It ain't no science but it gets me around
It's just a rock 'n roll strategy
Turn it up!

Can't win for losin'
Might as well be yourself

And when it gets so confusin'
Ya feel like checkin' out

Whoa oh oh oh oh
I got a system that's guaranteed

I got a rock 'n roll strategy

It ain't no science but it works for me
Just a rock 'n roll strategy

Get in my car
Head downtown

Turn up the radio, roll the windows down

It ain't no science but it gets me around
It's just a rock 'n roll strategy

I got a system
That's bonafiiide

Works for me every time I try

It ain't no science but it gets me by
It's just a rock 'n roll strategy
Turn it up!

I got a rock 'n roll strategy

It's just a rock 'n roll strategy
Heeey!

It's just a rock 'n roll strategy

Yeah yeah!

Rock 'n roll strategy
